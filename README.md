# Getting Started Redux-Saga

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This application retrieves information about cat breeds from the Cat API using Redux Saga, a middleware library for Redux. It fetches data from the API endpoint and stores it in the Redux store after formatting. The fetched cat breeds are then limited to the first 10 entries and dispatched to the Redux store. This application is ideal for displaying a curated list of cat breeds in a React application, with a focus on simplicity and ease of access to information about different cat breeds.
